		<p><em>"This whale burger is one of my family's favourite recipes. I invented it last week when I was thinking about what to make for dinner as I drove home. Ahead of me was a flat-bed truck carrying a recently deceased bowhead whale that had been found washed ashore. The gasses inside its festering corpse built to such a preasure that it caused the whale to explode. I scraped some of the remains off my windshield and voila! Dinner!"</em> -A.K.</p>
